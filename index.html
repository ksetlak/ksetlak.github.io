    <h1>Welcome to my personal website! (OK, webpage for now...)</h1>
    <p>
      I've created it to practice HTML, because it's an excellent <mark>programming language</mark>!
      <br>
      <br>I can't wait until I know so much HTML I can write my own simple <em>operating system</em> in it!
      <br>(But let's keep it <strong>simple</strong>, I just want something like Linux... Not a major one like MacOS!)
    </p>
    <div>Hello World!</div>
